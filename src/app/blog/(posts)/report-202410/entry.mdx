# Project Report: Project Setup and Concept Development

In the first month of the diploma thesis project, we focused on establishing the foundational aspects of the website and defining the overall concept. This included:

- Project Setup: The initial structure of the website was created to serve as the foundation for future development. This included setting up the development environment and necessary repositories.

- Concept Development: Work began on the conceptual design of the project. This involved outlining the core features, user interaction flows, and establishing architectural principles to guide development.

- Editor Component Research: We explored various editor components with the aim of integrating a reliable and efficient text/code editor into the platform. Usability, extensibility, and performance were key evaluation criteria.

- Workflow Exploration: Different workflow solutions were investigated to ensure seamless collaboration and efficient task management throughout the development cycle.

- Custom Backup Service: Parallel to the main development, we began building a minimal custom backup service tailored to the project's needs. This aligns with the principle of keeping services as lightweight and focused as possible.

- Design Philosophy: A core development principle was defined early on â€” keeping all services minimal to enhance maintainability and reduce system complexity.
