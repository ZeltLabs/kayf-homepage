# Project Report: Tracer Optimization, Workflow Expansion, and Security Focus

This month saw substantial architectural improvements, particularly around the Tracer system, while preparing for future enhancements and tightening timelines due to approaching final exams.

- Tracer Reimplementation and Optimization: The Tracer was largely reimplemented with a focus on performance and maintainability. It now supports efficient provider searching by storing separate indices per provider (document source) rather than a large, combined index.
    -This change eliminates the need for a filtering process, leading to faster and more scalable search performance.
    - The responsibilities of provider fetching and searching were separated, further improving modularity and system clarity.

- Workflow Node Development: Several new custom workflow nodes were added to extend the automation capabilities and align closer with project-specific needs.

- Website Redesign Planning: A website redesign is currently being planned to better reflect the evolving functionality and improved user experience requirements.

- Editor Security Concept: Work began on a new security concept for the editor, aiming to ensure data safety and resilience in collaborative environments.

- Timeline Pressure: Due to the upcoming final exams, development timelines are becoming tighter, and prioritization of critical features and stability is increasingly important.
