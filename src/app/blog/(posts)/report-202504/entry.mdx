# Project Report: Website Redesign, Editor Shift, and Service Architecture Overhaul

April marked a major evolution in the structure and presentation of the project. This month was focused on usability, modularity, and backend cohesion:

- Website Redesign Completed: The website underwent a major redesign, improving both the visual design and structural layout to better support the expanding features and modernized user experience. Navigation, clarity, and responsiveness were key focus areas.

- Editor Development Relocated: The ongoing editor development was moved into its own space, likely as a preparatory step for modularization and better deployment control. This reflects a shift toward isolating development domains to enhance flexibility and maintainability.

- Service Architecture Refactoring: The project was split into independent services, aligning with a microservice-like architecture. Each major system component now operates independently while remaining tightly integrated.

- Unified Database â€“ Single Source of Truth: All services now rely on the same centralized database, creating a single source of truth across the system. This reduces redundancy, simplifies data integrity, and enables more consistent state management throughout the application.
