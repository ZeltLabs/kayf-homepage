# Project Report: Architectural Evolution and Future Focus

June has been a pivotal month marked by internal restructuring, technology shifts, and renewed strategic focus as the team prepares for upcoming challenges and opportunities:

- Preparation for Jugend Innovativ: The team is actively preparing for the Jugend Innovativ competition, aiming to showcase the projectâ€™s maturity and innovative potential.

- Major Architectural Overhaul: After extensive experimentation throughout the thesis, the team has moved to a completely new architecture. This transition was instrumental for individual team members to deepen their expertise and specialize, resulting in a significantly stronger skill set and higher quality outcomes.

- Adoption of Lexical Editor: The project has now integrated Lexical as the editor component. Although the setup is complex and was previously infeasible during the thesis phase, the switch has proven worthwhile, delivering a robust and flexible editing experience.

- Tracer and Retriever Separation: The Tracer is undergoing final development to evolve into a general-purpose search engine, distinct from the Retriever component, which is now more aligned with the Kayf system. This clear separation improves modularity and focus.

- Internal Workflow Provider - Zynk: The team developed and adopted their own workflow provider named Zynk. Though still heavily in development, the concept is solid and functional, marking an important milestone in workflow customization and automation.

- Kayf Development and Vision: The Kayf component is set for another intensive development cycle. With an adjusted vision, the team is enthusiastic about its future and potential impact.
