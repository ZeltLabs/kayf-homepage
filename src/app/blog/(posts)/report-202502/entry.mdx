# Project Report: Infrastructure Strengthening and Frontend Development

This stage of the project focused on advancing infrastructure security and frontend integration:

- Authentication Service Setup: A fully functional authentication service has been implemented. It includes support for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), significantly enhancing user security and trust.

- Kubernetes Clusters Operational: The first Kubernetes clusters are now up and running. This marks a major milestone in the deployment pipeline, enabling scalable, containerized service management.

- Editor Frontend Development: Intense work is currently underway on the editor frontend. While significant progress has been made, parts of the interface and functionality remain somewhat segmented, with efforts ongoing to unify and streamline the experience.
