# Project Report: Technology Decisions and Core Feature Advancements

This development phase was marked by key architectural decisions and significant progress on collaborative functionality and backend features:

- Yjs Integration: After evaluating various options, Yjs was selected as the core framework for real-time collaboration. Its robust CRDT-based synchronization makes it a fitting choice for the project's collaborative editing needs.

- Editor Component â€“ BlockNote: The team chose BlockNote as the editor component due to its flexibility and seamless integration with Yjs. Its modern block-based structure aligns well with the intended user experience.

- Custom Workflow Nodes: The first custom workflow nodes were successfully implemented within the n8n automation system, marking a step forward in tailoring workflows to the project's specific requirements.

- Collaboration Functionality: With Yjs and BlockNote working in tandem, collaboration features are now functional, offering real-time editing capabilities with minimal setup complexity.

- Tracer Reimplementation: The Tracer component is undergoing a full reimplementation in C++ to improve performance and reliability, especially for handling complex and large-scale search tasks.
